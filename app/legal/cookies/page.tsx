        Our Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, how we use cookies, how third-party partners may
        use cookies on our Websites and your choices regarding cookies. It is intended to satisfy

      {/* 1. Why */}
      <h3>1. Why do we use &quot;cookies&quot; and other web-use tracking technologies?</h3>
      <ol className="legal-list-alpha">
        <li>
          When you access our Website, small files containing a unique identification (ID) number
          may be downloaded by your web browser and stored in the cache of your computer. The purpose
          of sending these files with a unique ID number is so that our Website can recognise your
          computer when you next visit. The &quot;cookies&quot; that are shared with your computer
          can&apos;t be used to discover any personal information such as your name, address or email
          address — they merely identify your computer to our Websites when you visit us.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can also log the internet protocol (IP) address of visitors so that we can work out the
          countries in which the computers are located.
        </li>
        <li>
          We collect information using &quot;cookies&quot; and other tracking technologies for the
          following reasons:
          <ol className="legal-list-roman mt-2">
            <li>to help us monitor the performance of our Website so that we can improve the operation of the Website and the services we offer;</li>
            <li>to provide personalised services to each user of our Website to make their navigation easier and more rewarding;</li>
            <li>to sell advertising on the Website in order to meet some of the costs of operating the Website and improve the content; and</li>
            <li>when we have permission from the user, to market the services we provide by sending emails personalised to the interests of the user.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Even if you have given us permission to send you emails, you can, at any time, decide not
          to receive further emails and will be able to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; from that service.
        </li>
        <li>
          In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage
          statistics of the Website, deliver advertisements and so on. See section 4 for the
          providers we currently work with.
        </li>
      </ol>

      {/* 2. What is a cookie */}
      <h3>2. What is a cookie (and what other technologies do we use)?</h3>
      <p>
        A cookie is a small text file a website asks your browser to save when you visit. We also use
        related technologies including pixel tags / web beacons, local storage, session storage and
        software development kits (SDKs) embedded in the Website. Throughout this policy
        &quot;cookies&quot; refers to all of these technologies.
      </p>

      {/* 3. Types of cookies */}
      <h3>3. Types of cookies we use</h3>
      <p>
        For visitors in the EEA, UK and other jurisdictions that require prior consent for
        non-essential cookies, only Strictly Necessary cookies are set before you make a choice.
        Other categories load only after you grant consent through our cookie banner.
      </p>
      <ol className="legal-list-alpha">
        <li>
          <strong>Strictly necessary.</strong> Required for the Website to function — session
          handling, security, load balancing and remembering your cookie-consent choice itself.
          These cannot be turned off.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Functional / preferences.</strong> Remember choices such as theme, region, language
          or recently viewed posts. These improve experience but are not essential.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance / analytics.</strong> Help us understand which articles get read, where
          visitors come from, and what we can improve. The data is aggregated and pseudonymised.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advertising / targeting.</strong> Used to show relevant advertising on and outside
          the Website and to measure ad performance. These set unique identifiers that may be
          considered &quot;sharing&quot; under California law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Affiliate tracking.</strong> When you click a retailer link from {SITE.name}, the affiliate
          service ({listOf(AFFILIATE_PROGRAMS.map((p) => p.name))}) and the retailer may set cookies to attribute a
          purchase to that click. Their link-conversion scripts load on this site only after you allow
          &quot;marketing&quot; cookies. These cookies are set by those companies, not by us, and are governed by
          their privacy policies.
        </li>
      </ol>

        international transfers.

          <strong>Cookie banner.</strong> If you are visiting from the EEA, UK, Switzerland, or a
          jurisdiction with similar requirements, our cookie banner asks for your consent before any
          non-essential cookie is set. You can accept all, reject non-essential, or open Settings to
          choose category by category. You can change your choice at any time from the &quot;Cookie
          settings&quot; link in our footer.

          <strong>Browser controls.</strong> Most browsers let you block, accept, or delete cookies
          via settings or preferences. Disabling some cookies may make parts of the site behave less
          well, but core reading functionality will continue to work.

          <strong>Global Privacy Control (GPC).</strong> If your browser sends a GPC signal, we treat
          it as a valid opt-out of &quot;sale or sharing&quot; for CCPA / state-law purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Do Not Track (DNT).</strong> We honor DNT browser signals where applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Email marketing.</strong> Every marketing email we send contains a one-click
          unsubscribe link.
