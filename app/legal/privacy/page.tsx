      {/* 1. What information do we collect? */}
      <h3>1. What information do we collect?</h3>
      <p>
        The kind of Personal Information that we collect from you will depend on how you use the
        Website. The Personal Information which we collect and hold about you may include:
      </p>
      <ol className="legal-list-alpha">
        <li>
          <strong>Identifiers and contact data</strong> — full name, email address, phone number,
          billing and shipping addresses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commercial information</strong> — purchase history, order details, customer
          preferences and interests, and (for our e-commerce operations including NXT Smart Home and
          NXT Outlet) payment information processed securely through third-party payment processors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Internet/network activity</strong> — IP address, browser type, device information,
          referring URLs, pages visited and time spent.
        </li>
        <li>

          <strong>Inferences</strong> — preferences and interests we infer from the above to
          personalise the experience.
        </li>
      </ol>

      {/* 2. Types of information */}
      <h3>2. Types of information</h3>
      <p>
        The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (<strong>Privacy Act</strong>) defines types of information,
        including Personal Information and Sensitive Information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Personal Information</strong> means information or an opinion about an identified
        individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:
      </p>
      <ol className="legal-list-alpha">
        <li>whether the information or opinion is true or not; and</li>
        <li>whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If the information does not disclose your identity or enable your identity to be ascertained,
        it will in most cases not be classified as &quot;Personal Information&quot; and will not be
        subject to this privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sensitive Information</strong> is defined in the Privacy Act as including information
        or opinion about such things as an individual&apos;s racial or ethnic origin, political
        opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs,
        membership of a trade union or other professional body, criminal record or health
        information. Under the GDPR this is referred to as <em>special category data</em>.
      </p>
      <p>Sensitive / special category information will be used by us only:</p>
      <ol className="legal-list-alpha">
        <li>for the primary purpose for which it was obtained;</li>
        <li>for a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose; and</li>
        <li>with your explicit consent or where required or authorised by law.</li>
      </ol>

      {/* 3. How we collect your Personal Information */}
      <h3>3. How we collect your Personal Information</h3>
      <ol className="legal-list-alpha">
        <li>
          We may collect Personal Information from you whenever you input such information into the
          Website, related app or provide it to us in any other way.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may also use cookies and similar technologies which enable us to tell when you use the
          Website and to help customise your experience. See our{' '}
          <Link href="/legal/cookies">Cookie Policy</Link> for details and how to manage your
          choices.
        </li>
        <li>
          We generally don&apos;t collect Sensitive Information, but when we do, we will comply with
          the preceding paragraph.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where reasonable and practicable we collect your Personal Information from you only.
          However, sometimes we may be given information from a third party (such as our advertising
          or analytics partners); in those cases we will take steps to make you aware of the
          information that was provided.
        </li>
      </ol>

      {/* 4. Purpose of collection (lawful bases) */}
      <h3>4. Purpose and lawful basis of collection</h3>
      <ol className="legal-list-alpha">
        <li>
          We collect Personal Information to provide you with the best service experience possible
          on the Website, fulfill orders for our e-commerce operations, respond to enquiries and
          keep in touch with you about developments in our business.
        </li>
        <li>
          For visitors in the EEA / UK, the lawful bases on which we rely are (Article 6 GDPR / UK
          GDPR):
          <ol className="legal-list-roman mt-2">
            <li><strong>Consent</strong> — for non-essential cookies, marketing emails, and any optional analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>Contract</strong> — to fulfill orders and provide services you have requested.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — for site security, fraud prevention, basic analytics, and direct marketing of our own similar products to existing customers (subject to your right to object at any time).</li>
            <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> — to comply with tax, accounting and other applicable laws.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          We customarily disclose Personal Information only to our service providers who assist us in
          operating the Website (hosting, email delivery, analytics, payment processors, customer
          support tools). Each service provider is bound by contract to handle your data only for
          documented purposes and to maintain appropriate security.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will only use your Personal Information for direct marketing if we have collected it
          directly from you, and only if it is material of a type which you would reasonably expect
          to receive. We do not use sensitive Personal Information in direct marketing. Every
          marketing email contains a one-click unsubscribe link.
        </li>
      </ol>

      {/* 5. Security, Access and correction */}
      <h3>5. Security, retention and your rights</h3>
      <ol className="legal-list-alpha">
        <li>
          We store your Personal Information using industry-standard technical and organisational
          measures (encryption in transit, access controls, regular reviews) to reasonably protect it
          from unauthorised access, misuse, modification or disclosure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Retention.</strong> When we no longer require your Personal Information for the
          purpose for which we obtained it, we will take reasonable steps to destroy and anonymise or
          de-identify it. Most Personal Information stored in our client files and records will be
          kept for a maximum of 7 years to fulfill our record-keeping obligations. Email
          correspondence is retained as long as it remains useful for support or legal record-keeping.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Australian Privacy Principles permit you to:
          <ol className="legal-list-roman mt-2">
            <li>obtain access to the Personal Information we hold about you in certain circumstances (Australian Privacy Principle 12); and</li>
            <li>correct inaccurate Personal Information subject to certain exceptions (Australian Privacy Principle 13).</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Where you would like to obtain such access, please contact us in writing on the contact
          details set out at the bottom of this privacy policy. We respond within 30 days for AU

      {/* 6. Complaint procedure */}
      <h3>6. Complaint procedure</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a complaint concerning the manner in which we maintain the privacy of your
        Personal Information, please contact us at{' '}
        <a href="mailto:privacy@bestlooking.skin">privacy@bestlooking.skin</a>. All complaints will be
        considered by Kritin Curtis and we may seek further information from you to clarify your
        concerns. If we agree that your complaint is well founded, we will, in consultation with you,
        take appropriate steps to rectify the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you remain dissatisfied with the outcome you may refer the matter to the Office of the
        Australian Information Commissioner (<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oaic.gov.au</a>),
        or, if you are based in the EEA / UK, to your local data-protection supervisory authority.
      </p>

      {/* 7. Overseas transfer */}
      <h3>7. International data transfers</h3>
      <p>
        Your Personal Information may be transferred overseas or stored overseas for a variety of
        reasons (cloud hosting, email delivery, customer-support platforms). We use providers
        primarily located in Australia, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where Personal Information is transferred from the EEA or UK to a country that has not been
        the subject of a European Commission adequacy decision, we rely on Standard Contractual
        Clauses (the EU SCCs as updated 4 June 2021, and the UK International Data Transfer
        Addendum) and additional supplementary measures where appropriate, in accordance with
        Articles 45-49 GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Australian residents, where Personal Information is sent to a country with data
        protection laws substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles, we will not be
        liable for a breach of those Principles if your Personal Information is mishandled in that
        jurisdiction. Where it is transferred to a jurisdiction with less comprehensive laws, we will
        take reasonable steps to secure a contractual commitment from the recipient to handle your
        information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.
      </p>
